# Lesson 01 - First World on Screen

## Duration
60-90 minutes

## Goal
By the end of this lesson, Jonah can explain and edit a basic game loop that draws a grid and moves one creature on a 2D board.

## Concepts (Keep To Three)
- Coordinate grids (`x`, `y`)
- Update vs draw loop
- Boundary checks

## Session Flow
1. Warm-up (10 min)
- Run the project.
- Ask Jonah what each visible part means (grid, creature, tick).

2. Guided coding (30-40 min)
- Identify where board size and cell size are configured.
- Change one config value and rerun.
- Trace one tick of creature movement.

3. Jonah challenge (15-20 min)
- Make one controlled behavior change:
  - Option A: Increase board size.
  - Option B: Slow down FPS.
  - Option C: Keep creatures from standing still.
- Jonah explains what changed and why.

4. Debrief (10 min)
- Write one reflection sentence.
- Save evidence (commit hash + screenshot).

## Success Criteria
- Jonah can point to where movement happens in code.
- Jonah can change one parameter and predict the effect.
- Session log is completed with evidence.
