# Living Curriculum

Use this as the single source of truth. Update it after each session.

## Program Goals
- Teach Jonah core Python and simulation thinking through playful experiments.
- Build a 2D creature world where interactions are based on rock-paper-scissors.
- Keep progress visible for learning reflection and possible school credit.

## Current Focus
- Phase: Foundations
- Current target: Interactive 2D board with moving creatures
- Definition of done for this phase:
  - Board renders consistently.
  - Creatures move each tick.
  - Creature encounters resolve via RPS rules.

## Next Session Draft
- Primary goal: Build a visible grid and basic creature movement.
- Stretch goal: Add one encounter rule.
- Jonah challenge: Change one simulation parameter and explain the result.

## Backlog
Choose from this list each session based on interest and momentum.

### Ready Now
- Create fixed-size board render.
- Add simulation loop and tick counter.
- Add creature state (x, y, type).
- Add random movement with boundary rules.
- Add encounter detection on shared tile.
- Add RPS winner/loser resolution.

### Next
- Add HUD stats (counts of rock/paper/scissors).
- Add reproducibility with random seed.
- Add config file for board size and spawn count.
- Add pause/step controls.

### Later
- Add creature behavior variants (aggressive, avoidant, random).
- Add food/resource mechanics.
- Add reproduction and mutation experiments.
- Add experiment presets and result comparison.

## Session Update Routine (5-10 min)
1. Create a new session log from `docs/session-logs/TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Add or reorder items in `Ready Now` based on today’s outcomes.
3. Move finished items to `Completed Milestones`.
4. Update `Next Session Draft` with one primary goal and one stretch goal.
