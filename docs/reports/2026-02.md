# Monthly Programming Report - February 2026

## Student
- Name: Jonah
- Project: Creature Simulation (2D RPS World)

## Summary
- Total sessions: 2
- Total hours: Open-ended session durations (not timeboxed)
- Main outcomes:
  - Session planning/documentation workflow established.
  - First playable continuous 2D arena simulation completed.
  - Added headless mode for winner reporting and experiment runs.

## Skills Practiced
- Python fundamentals: dataclasses, function arguments, CLI parsing, file I/O.
- Problem decomposition: split gameplay into movement, encounters, rendering, and headless simulation.
- Debugging: fixed overwritten CLI behavior and verified with targeted tests/help output.
- Simulation design: continuous coordinates, delta-time movement, speed randomization, and elimination/convert encounter modes.
- Data/observation: used HUD, screenshots, and headless winner outputs to reason about strategy outcomes.

## Work Completed (By Session)
| Date | Duration | Focus | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-02-08 | Planning only | Curriculum/report structure | Living curriculum, session template, monthly report template |
| 2026-02-08 | Open-ended | Playable RPS simulation build | Continuous arena, image sprites, controls, headless winner mode, tests |

## Code Evidence
- Repository path: `/home/jonah/programe_things/rpsbattle`
- Notable commits:
  - `4f219d3` feat: add headless winner mode, image sprites, TPS controls, and no-convert elimination rules
- Key files:
  - `src/sim/game.py`
  - `src/sim/app.py`
  - `src/sim/cli.py`
  - `src/sim/render.py`
  - `tests/test_game.py`
  - `tests/test_app.py`
  - `docs/session-logs/2026-02-08-game-kickoff.md`

## Reflection
- What Jonah can now do:
  - Run and tune the simulation with CLI flags.
  - Explain delta-time movement and random seed effects.
  - Read test outcomes and connect them to behavior changes.
- Biggest challenge encountered:
  - Avoiding accidental overwrite of `cli.py` and preserving intended run options.
- Plan for next month:
  - Run repeated headless experiments, analyze win-rate patterns, and add controlled spawn setups plus arena features.

## Parent/Mentor Notes
- Jonah made strong observations about second-order strategy effects (largest group is not always safest in RPS dynamics).
