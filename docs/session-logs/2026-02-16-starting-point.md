# Session Log - 2026-02-16

## Session Info
- Participants: Jonah
- Focus: Record baseline state of the project with screenshots

## Note
The 3 most recent screenshots are the beginning, middle, and end of our starting point of the program as it is now.

## Observation Note
At the start there is a mix, but in the middle scissors had the most. In the end rock won because the scissors killed all of the papers, so the rock could not be killed.
