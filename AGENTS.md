## Project Overlay
This file defines project-specific context for `rpsbattle`.
Shared workflow/policy comes from:
- `shared/sheffler_standards/docs/AGENTS.base.md`

## Purpose and Audience
This is a learning project for Jonah and Will.
Participants:
- Student Jonah (15, basic Python)
- Father/teacher Will (professional software engineer)

Primary goals:
- Teach core programming and simulation concepts.
- Have fun building evolving creature simulations together.
- Make scientific observations about simulation results.
- Maintain school-credit-friendly documentation of progress.

## Project Direction
- Build creature simulations in a 2D world (Primer-style experiments).
- Start simple and layer complexity gradually.
- First milestone: a 2D board where creatures interact via rock-paper-scissors.

## Project-Specific Notes
- Keep lesson examples aligned with Jonah's current project context and pace.
- Keep simulation logic testable independently of graphics.
